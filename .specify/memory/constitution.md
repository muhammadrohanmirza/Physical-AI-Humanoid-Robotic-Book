# Physical AI Book Constitution

## Vision

To create an accessible, comprehensive guide that demystifies Physical AI for beginners and intermediate learners, combining theoretical foundations with hands-on experimentation to enable readers to understand, implement, and innovate in the field of AI interacting with physical systems.

## Core Principles

### Hands-On Learning Approach
Every concept in the book must be accompanied by practical exercises and examples; readers should be able to implement what they learn immediately through guided hands-on activities and experiments.

### Beginner-Friendly Accessibility
Content must be accessible to beginners with step-by-step explanations, visual aids, and minimal prerequisites; complex concepts should be broken down into digestible segments with clear progression paths.

### Docusaurus-Based Documentation
All content and documentation must be structured using Docusaurus to ensure consistent navigation, search capabilities, and responsive design across devices.

### Real-World Application Focus
Every chapter should connect theoretical concepts to real-world physical AI applications, demonstrating how principles translate to practical implementations in robotics, simulation, or physical systems.

### Interactive Engagement
Content should encourage reader interaction through exercises, thought experiments, code examples, and challenges that reinforce learning objectives.

### Iterative Knowledge Building
Concepts should build progressively from fundamental principles to advanced topics, ensuring each builds upon previously established knowledge without gaps.

## Success Criteria

- Reader feedback surveys showing comprehension and satisfaction
- Completion rates of hands-on exercises
- GitHub activity and contributions to associated code repositories
- Number of successful implementations of book concepts by readers

## Constraints

- Target audience limitations requiring simplified explanations without sacrificing technical accuracy
- Docusaurus formatting requirements constraining presentation options
- Need for balance between theoretical depth and practical accessibility
- Resource limitations for creating physical demonstrations and simulations
- Time constraints for content development and review cycles

## Stakeholders

- Primary: Beginners and intermediate learners interested in Physical AI
- Secondary: Educators using the book as course material
- Contributors: Technical writers, subject matter experts, and community members
- Maintainers: Core development team responsible for ongoing content updates

## Brand Voice

Clear, approachable, and technically accurate. The tone should be encouraging to newcomers while maintaining credibility for more experienced practitioners. Language should favor simplicity over complexity when possible, always explain jargon, and maintain enthusiasm for the possibilities of Physical AI.

## Governance
This constitution governs all content creation and documentation efforts; All contributors must comply with these principles; Amendments require team consensus and stakeholder approval.
