# Exercise 2.1: Sensor Selection Challenge

## Objective

To understand the trade-offs involved in selecting sensors for Physical AI applications by designing a sensor system for a specific use case.

## Background

You are tasked with designing the sensor system for an autonomous delivery robot that operates in urban environments. The robot needs to navigate sidewalks, cross streets at intersections, avoid obstacles, and safely deliver packages to customers.

## Requirements

The delivery robot must be able to:
1. Navigate safely along sidewalks and pathways
2. Detect and avoid obstacles (people, vehicles, street furniture)
3. Cross streets at designated crosswalks
4. Identify delivery locations
5. Operate in various lighting and weather conditions
6. Detect and respond to traffic signals and signs

## Part 1: Sensor Inventory

List at least 5 different types of sensors that could be used in this application, including:
- The sensor type
- What it measures
- Its advantages for this application
- Its limitations

## Part 2: Sensor Configuration

For each sensor you selected:
1. Specify the number of sensors needed
2. Describe where they would be mounted on the robot
3. Explain why this positioning is optimal
4. Estimate the cost impact of each sensor type

## Part 3: Fusion Strategy

Describe how you would combine information from multiple sensors:
1. Which sensors would provide complementary information?
2. How would you handle sensor failures?
3. What would be your primary navigation sensor?
4. How would you ensure safety if the primary sensor fails?

## Part 4: Environmental Considerations

Consider how your sensor system would perform in various conditions:
1. Daylight vs. nighttime operation
2. Rain, snow, or fog
3. Direct sunlight or shadows
4. Areas with many reflective surfaces

## Deliverables

1. **Sensor List**: Complete Part 1 with at least 5 sensor types
2. **Configuration Plan**: Complete Part 2 with mounting and reasoning
3. **Fusion Plan**: Complete Part 3 with combination strategy
4. **Environmental Analysis**: Complete Part 4 with condition considerations
5. **Justification**: A summary explaining why your sensor selection best meets the requirements

## Evaluation Criteria

- **Completeness**: All aspects of sensor selection addressed
- **Technical Accuracy**: Appropriate sensor choices for the application
- **Trade-off Analysis**: Recognition of advantages and limitations
- **Safety Focus**: Consideration of fail-safe operation
- **Cost Awareness**: Understanding of cost implications
- **Clarity**: Clear and organized presentation

## Extension Challenge

Research a real-world autonomous delivery robot and compare your sensor selection to what is actually used. Identify similarities and differences, and explain why the actual implementation might differ from your design.
