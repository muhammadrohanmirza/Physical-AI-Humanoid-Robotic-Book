# Exercise 1.1: Understanding Physical AI Systems

## Objective

To understand and identify the key components of Physical AI systems in everyday life by analyzing real-world examples.

## Instructions

Identify three different Physical AI systems from your daily life or research three examples. For each system, identify and describe:

1. **Sensors**: What sensors does the system use to perceive the environment?
2. **Actuators**: What actuators does the system use to affect the environment?
3. **Perception-Action Loop**: How does the system connect perception to action?
4. **Key Challenge**: What is one key challenge this system faces that is unique to Physical AI?

## Examples to Consider

- Smart home devices (thermostats, security cameras, lighting)
- Smartphones (camera features, voice assistants, navigation)
- Transportation (GPS navigation, parking assistance, adaptive cruise control)
- Appliances (robotic vacuum cleaners, washing machines, ovens)
- Entertainment (gaming, smart TVs, streaming recommendations)

## Deliverables

For each of the three systems you analyze:
1. A brief description of the system (2-3 sentences)
2. List of sensors and their functions
3. List of actuators and their functions
4. Description of how perception leads to action
5. Identification of one unique Physical AI challenge

## Evaluation Criteria

- **Completeness**: All required components identified for each system
- **Accuracy**: Correct identification of sensors, actuators, and challenges
- **Insight**: Understanding of how the physical environment affects the AI system
- **Clarity**: Clear, well-organized presentation of findings

## Extension Challenge

For an additional challenge, consider how the systems you identified might adapt their behavior based on changing environmental conditions or user preferences over time.
