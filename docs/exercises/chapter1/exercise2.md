# Exercise 1.2: Sensor Analysis and Fusion

## Objective

To analyze sensor systems in Physical AI and understand the benefits of sensor fusion through practical examples.

## Background

In this exercise, you'll examine how different types of sensors contribute to Physical AI systems and explore the advantages of sensor fusion for improving perception accuracy and reliability.

## Part 1: Single Sensor Analysis

Choose one of the following Physical AI systems:
- Autonomous vehicle
- Smart doorbell/camera system
- Robot vacuum cleaner
- Drone
- Smartphone camera (with multiple features)

For your chosen system, analyze:
1. One sensor from the system (e.g., camera, LiDAR, ultrasonic sensor)
2. What information this sensor provides
3. Limitations of using only this sensor in the system
4. Conditions where this sensor might fail or be inaccurate

## Part 2: Multi-Sensor Analysis

Identify two additional sensors from the same system you chose in Part 1.
For each sensor:
1. Describe what information it provides
2. Explain how it could complement the first sensor
3. Identify conditions where this sensor would be particularly valuable

## Part 3: Sensor Fusion Scenario

Describe a specific scenario in which your chosen system would benefit from sensor fusion:
1. Describe the environmental conditions
2. Explain which sensors would be most valuable in this scenario
3. Describe how the system would integrate information from multiple sensors
4. Explain how the fused information would improve system performance over a single sensor approach

## Deliverables

1. **Single Sensor Analysis**: Complete Part 1 for your chosen system
2. **Multi-Sensor Analysis**: Complete Part 2 for two additional sensors
3. **Fusion Scenario**: Complete Part 3 with a detailed scenario
4. **Summary**: A paragraph explaining why sensor fusion is important in Physical AI

## Evaluation Criteria

- **Technical Understanding**: Accurate identification of sensor capabilities and limitations
- **Analysis Quality**: Thorough examination of how sensors complement each other
- **Scenario Realism**: Practical and realistic fusion scenario
- **Critical Thinking**: Insight into the benefits and challenges of sensor fusion
- **Communication**: Clear and organized presentation

## Extension Challenge

Research a real-world failure of a Physical AI system that might have been prevented with better sensor fusion. Describe what happened, what sensors were involved, and how sensor fusion might have prevented the issue.
